Welcome to the Bitcoin Services Demo.

Bitcoin is a digital currency, based on the implementation of Blockchain technology.

Blockchain is a open, distributed ledger

that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records called blocks
each block is fault tolerant and cannot be altered retroactively
blockchain use cases include: medical record keeping, transaction processing and identity management
Now, what if blockchain service users require mobile access and API management.

Introducing

Red Hat Mobile Application Platform for MBaaS hosting and development
3Scale APICast for API management and integration
This set of assets comes with architecture diagrams and use cases...

Glad to hear your feedback :D
